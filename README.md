# Secret Family Recipes Cookbook

index.html: this page uses the less files for its style. The script for the nav is in index.js. -needs async.

-.body wraps the whole page. Line-height, font-family, and color is set here. It is also used for margins @ 500px.

-.navBox wraps the whole top nav bar and ends before the .navbtn. .navBox centers the text. Adds padding and margin. @500px it changes the top margin.

-#myNav is the id used for DOM function

-.overlay aligns content inside of the nav and sets the background of the nav bar.

-A .closebtn uses JS:void(0) to keep the page from refreshing. This is the close btn for the navbar. It uses inline JS (bad practice). This could be changed by adding an ID to the close and open buttons.
-.overlay-content sets the position and some other styling of the link to the about.html.
