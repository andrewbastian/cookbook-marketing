# Secret Family Recipes Cookbook

## Description

Anyone can go out and buy a cookbook these days, but I want a place to
store all my secret family recipes, handed down from generation to generation.
The little cards my grandma wrote the recipes on in her beautiful cursive are
getting lost or are hard to read. I need somewhere secure to keep my recipes
with me at all times!

## MVP

- Onboarding process for a new user
- Ability to enter a new recipe, including title, source (i.e. Grandma Ethel),
  ingredients, instructions, and category (dinner, chicken, dessert, pasta, etc.)
  and edit or delete it later.
- Homepage to view all entered recipes.
- Ability to search for recipes by title or tagged categories

## Stretch

- Ability to upload a picture of the original recipe along with the recipe entry.
- By default all recipes uploaded can only be viewed by the person loggin in,
  a stretch goal would add the ability to invite someone with the link to view the recipe.
